# MacBook Remote Terminal Access with Automated Setup

## Overview

This documentation describes a modern, script-based approach to setting up secure remote terminal access from iPhone/iPad to your MacBook using SSH certificates, Zellij terminal multiplexer, and enterprise-grade security.

**Key improvements over the original manual setup:**

- ü§ñ **Automated scripts** for all configuration steps
- üì± **Mobile-first design** with QR codes and setup wizards
- üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced security** with certificate authentication and rate limiting
- üîß **Comprehensive tooling** for monitoring, troubleshooting, and maintenance
- üìä **Health checks** and diagnostics for system reliability

## What's New: Script-Based Architecture

The setup has been completely modularized into purpose-built scripts that handle all the manual configuration steps from the original guide:

### Setup Scripts

- `setup_ssh` - Complete SSH certificate authority and server configuration
- `setup_security` - SSHGuard, SOPS encryption, and firewall rules
- `setup_service` - macOS LaunchAgent services for persistence

### Mobile Configuration

- `generate_qr_config` - QR codes for easy iPhone/iPad setup
- `setup_iphone_guide` - Interactive mobile setup wizard

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- `remote_health_check` - Comprehensive system health monitoring
- `connection_test` - Connection testing suite
- `cert_status` - Certificate management and renewal
- `troubleshoot_remote` - Advanced diagnostic and repair tools

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Deploy Configuration Files

```bash
# From the ~/.file directory
cd ~/.file
stow .
```

This symlinks all configuration files to their proper system locations.

### 2. Run Setup Scripts (in order)

```bash
# 1. Set up SSH certificates and server configuration
~/.local/bin/setup_ssh

# 2. Configure security services (SSHGuard, firewall, SOPS)
~/.local/bin/setup_security

# 3. Install and start system services
~/.local/bin/setup_service install
```

### 3. Generate Mobile Configuration

```bash
# Generate certificates and QR codes for iPhone setup
~/.local/bin/generate_qr_config all

# Run interactive mobile setup guide
~/.local/bin/setup_iphone_guide
```

### 4. Verify Setup

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
~/.local/bin/remote_health_check

# Test all connections
~/.local/bin/connection_test
```

## Detailed Setup Process

### Phase 1: SSH Certificate Infrastructure

The `setup_ssh` script automates the complete SSH certificate setup:

**What it does:**

- Enables SSH service on port 2222
- Creates Certificate Authority (CA) with ed25519 keys
- Generates host and user certificates (1-year validity)
- Installs SSH hardening configuration
- Sets up certificate-based authentication

**Manual steps required:**

- Run with sudo privileges when prompted
- Confirm SSH service restart

**Generated files:**

- `~/.ssh/ca/ssh_ca` - CA private key (secure)
- `~/.ssh/ca/ssh_ca.pub` - CA public key
- `~/.ssh/id_ed25519-cert.pub` - User certificate
- `/etc/ssh/trusted_user_ca_keys` - System CA trust
- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config.d/99_custom.conf` - SSH hardening

### Phase 2: Security Hardening

The `setup_security` script implements enterprise-grade security:

**What it does:**

- Configures SSHGuard for brute-force protection
- Sets up SOPS for encrypted configuration storage
- Installs pf firewall rules with rate limiting
- Creates secure configuration management tools

**Manual steps required:**

- Firewall rules activation (script will prompt)
- Review generated age encryption key

**Generated services:**

- SSHGuard with automatic IP blocking
- pf firewall with SSH rate limiting (5 conn/30sec)
- SOPS encrypted config management
- Mosh UDP port allowances (60000-61000)

### Phase 3: System Services

The `setup_service` script manages persistent services:

**What it does:**

- Creates LaunchAgent plists for SSH keepalive
- Sets up Zellij session restoration service
- Manages service loading/unloading
- Provides service status monitoring

**Manual steps required:**

- None - fully automated

**Services created:**

- `com.user.ssh_keepalive` - Maintains SSH connectivity
- `com.user.zellij_restore` - Auto-restores Zellij sessions

### Phase 4: Mobile Client Setup

The mobile setup tools provide multiple configuration methods:

**QR Code Generation (`generate_qr_config`):**

- SSH client configuration QR codes
- Termius app-specific configuration
- Blink Shell configuration
- Connection information summary
- Certificate package for secure transfer

**Interactive Setup (`setup_iphone_guide`):**

- Step-by-step mobile configuration
- App-specific instructions (Termius, Blink Shell)
- Security best practices
- Troubleshooting guidance

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Health Monitoring

```bash
# Comprehensive system health check
~/.local/bin/remote_health_check

# Specific component tests
~/.local/bin/connection_test ssh
~/.local/bin/cert_status renewal
~/.local/bin/setup_firewall status
```

### Certificate Management

```bash
# Check certificate expiry
~/.local/bin/cert_status

# Renew certificates (automatic check)

### Common Issues

**Connection Refused:**

- Check SSH service: `sudo launchctl list | grep ssh`
- Verify port 2222: `lsof -i :2222`
- Test firewall: `~/.local/bin/setup_firewall test`

**Authentication Failed:**

- Check certificates: `~/.local/bin/cert_status`
- Test local connection: `ssh -p 2222 localhost`
- Renew if expired: `~/.local/bin/renew_ssh_cert force`

**Mobile App Issues:**

- Regenerate QR codes: `~/.local/bin/generate_qr_config all`
- Check certificate transfer: `~/.local/bin/generate_qr_config certs`
- Review setup guide: `~/.local/bin/setup_iphone_guide`

## Manual Configuration Required

While most setup is automated, some steps require manual intervention:

### Initial Dependencies

```bash
# Install required packages (if not already installed)
brew install mosh sshguard sops age qrencode
```

### Network Configuration

- **Router settings:** Ensure MacBook has static/reserved IP
- **Firewall exceptions:** Allow SSH (port 2222) and Mosh (UDP 60000-61000) through any router firewall

### Mobile App Installation

- Install SSH client app (Termius, Blink Shell, etc.) from App Store
- Import generated certificates manually via secure transfer method
- For iPhone-specific setup instructions, see [`iphone_setup.md`](iphone_setup.md).

### Certificate Transfer

- Use AirDrop, secure email, or USB for certificate files
- Delete temporary files after successful import
- Verify certificate import in mobile app
