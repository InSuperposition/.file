## Installation

This repo uses [gnu `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to symlink the contents of the folder in the user's `$HOME` (`~`) folder by default.

`stow` is a symlink farm manager which is used to manage dotfiles. This repository contains instructions on how to use stow to manage dotfiles.

```sh
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/.config
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=$HOME/.cache
